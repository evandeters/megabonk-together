# Network chnages

Read [Readme](README.md) first and ensure the mod is installed

This will list hopefully exhaustively what are the changes made by the mod.
Those change where made for balances purposes.

## Pause ? what is that ?

There is no pause on netplay. Die

## Synchronization

Most of the stuff are synchronized but some are per player while other are fully sychronized

For example buying something from the shady guy is locally simulated meaning he won't flee when you buy somehing for the others

Charging shrines are instead fully synchronized meaning every one will get the bonus.

> [!NOTE]  
> There is a bug where you can miss either your level up or your shrine upgrade because both can't happen at the same time. Will try to fix later

Magnet (Shrine and pickup) make the xp goes to a random player (No the one that interacted won't get all the xp)

You get i-frames when leveling up/getting a reward/openning a chest. This is to counter balance the fact that the game won't be paused anymore. 5 sec for choosing a reward and 1 second when finishing

> You can also still move behind when selecting a reward

## Disabled Save/Steam interaction

The game naturally save progression and update your achievement. The game is not really meant to be played online so all of the save/steam interaction is prohibited when playing a netplay game.
Same thing with uploading your score to the leaderbord, you would get banned anyway , so let's not do that 😅

The experimental `Save progression` option (under `Netplay options`) lifts the save restriction **for your own save only**. It is a local setting: the host enabling it does not enable it for the clients, so every player who wants to keep their progression must turn it on themselves (the friendlies lobby panel shows `Save progression (you)`). When enabled, your progression is also written when the mod sends you back to the menu (host or other players leaving). Leaderboard and Steam achievement/stat uploads stay blocked either way.

## Custom game balance

The mod feature some game code to try to re balance the game as more player join a session.
This is **CERTAINLY** not perfect and probably unbalanced right now and will need to be tuned as more people try and report (For any dev ,the class i'm refering is `GameBalanceService.cs`). Those are the stat being modified:

- Credit timer , The credit is a value the in game sumonner use to know how much it can spawn enemies. The more player, the more credit the summonner get

- Free Chest Spawn Rate, the more player we have in a session, the more free chest we should have on the map

- Pickup Xp : The xp you get from the pickup, since pickup are synchronized, i realized player get rapidly under level since they are sharing XP. The mod will boost a bit the reward of XP on netplay to counterbalance the fact that there are less XP. The current balance is **DOUBLE** XP for 2-4 players and **TRIPLE** XP for 5 and 6 players.

- Boss lamp charge: In the graveyard, the final boss is naturally weaker the more player with have as they can quicly charge lamp on their own. To counterbalance that, there is some additionnal time required to charge a lamp. The initial charge time when playing solo is 3, its doubled for example at 2 players and quadrupled at six players.

- Max spawnable enemies: 400 and under on a final swarm (keeping the original cap) ,500 up to 4 player and 600 for 5-6 players (untested ,you have been warned)
